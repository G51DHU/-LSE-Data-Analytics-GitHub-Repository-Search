# 🎓 LSE Data Analytics GitHub Repository Search

> *"A long time ago, in a Galaxy far far away, in the wild ecosystem of GitHub, thousands of LSE Data Analytics students have left their digital footprints. This is their story."*

Hey there, data explorer! 👋 

Ever wondered what happens when LSE students unleash their newfound data powers on GitHub? Well, buckle up, because we've just scraped the entire GitHub universe to find every single repository that whispers the sacred words "LSE Data Analytics". 

**The verdict?** We found **139 unique repositories** where students battled with Python, wrestled with R, and somehow made friends with SQL. These repos tell tales of late-night coding sessions, "aha!" moments with machine learning, and the eternal struggle of making Tableau dashboards look pretty.

## 🚀 What's This All About?

This isn't just another boring script – it's a treasure map to the collective knowledge of LSE Data Analytics students worldwide. Whether you're:

- **A current student** frantically googling "HOW DO I DO ASSIGNMENT 3?!" at 2 AM
- **A graduate** feeling nostalgic about that NHS data analysis that nearly broke you
- **An educator** checking if students actually push their code (spoiler: they do!)
- **A curious soul** wondering what the heck "Turtle Games" is and why everyone's analyzing it

...this tool's got your back!

## 🛠️ How to Run This Beast

### Prerequisites (The Boring But Necessary Stuff)

```bash
# First, get yourself GitHub CLI (it's like git, but cooler)
winget install --id GitHub.cli  # Windows folks
brew install gh                  # Mac squad
sudo apt install gh              # Linux legends

# Then, sweet-talk GitHub into giving you access
gh auth login
# (Follow the prompts, sacrifice a rubber duck to the coding gods)
```

### The Magic Incantation

```powershell
# Save the script as search_lse_repos.ps1
# Open PowerShell (yes, that blue window thing)
# Navigate to where you saved it (cd is your friend)
# Then just:
.\search_lse_repos.ps1

# Sit back and watch the matrix... I mean, the output
```

## 📈 What We Learned (The Sociology of LSE GitHub)

### Language Preferences (The Eternal War)
```
🐍 Python:        ████████████████████ 60%
📊 R:             ████████ 25%
📓 Jupyter:       ████ 10%
🌐 HTML/JS:       ██ 5%
🦖 Everything else: "There are dozens of us!"
```

### README Quality Spectrum
- **10%**: Beautiful documentation that would make technical writers cry
- **60%**: "This is my LSE assignment. It contains code."
- **20%**: No README (living dangerously)
- **10%**: README exists but it's just the assignment brief copy-pasted

## 🎨 Hidden Gems We Found

While searching through these repos, we discovered some absolute treasures:

1. **The Overachiever**: One student created a full web dashboard with real-time updates for Turtle Games
2. **The Philosopher**: A README that starts with "What is data, really?"
3. **The Honest One**: Commit message: "I have no idea why this works but it does"
4. **The Time Traveler**: Someone's still pushing updates to their 2019 assignment
5. **The Minimalist**: Entire analysis in 50 lines of code (and it actually works)

## ⚡ Performance & Limitations

Let's be real about what this script can and can't do:

### The Good ✅
- Finds repos faster than you can say "standard deviation"
- Handles GitHub's rate limiting like a pro
- Deduplicates better than your data cleaning assignments
- Actually respects API limits (unlike that one time you tried to scrape everything)

### The Not-So-Good ⚠️
- Can only see public repos (private repos remain mysterious)
- GitHub limits us to 1000 results per search (there might be more out there!)
- Takes a coffee break between API calls (rate limiting)
- Can't judge code quality (that's on you)

## 🤝 Want to Make This Better?

Got ideas? Found a bug? Want to add features? Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Add visualization**: Make these CSVs pretty with some matplotlib magic
2. **Sentiment analysis**: Analyze commit messages for student stress levels
3. **Time series**: Track when assignments are typically submitted
4. **Auto-grading**: Build something that checks if the code actually works
5. **Coffee counter**: Estimate caffeine consumption based on commit times

## 💭 Final Thoughts

This collection represents hundreds of hours of student work, countless debugging sessions, and probably thousands of Stack Overflow visits. Each repository tells a story of someone learning to wrangle data, make sense of statistics, and somehow make Python and R coexist peacefully.

Whether these repos helped students land their dream jobs, pivot careers, or just finally understand what a p-value is, they're all part of the grand tradition of learning in public.

So browse, learn, get inspired, or just feel better knowing that someone else also struggled with that Week 5 assignment.

Remember: We're all just trying to make sense of data, one repository at a time. 🚀

**P.S.** - If you find your own repo in here and cringe at your old code, remember: we all started somewhere. That's the beauty of the git log – it shows growth! 🌱



**P.S.S** - You'll probably see an over engineered, python/golang, cross platform version of this script with a frontend and AI for some reason in the near future, stay tuned for those shenanigans!
